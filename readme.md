## Overview

Our design uses monocular camera to detect humans and get their positions in the robot’s reference frame. The module is developed in such a way that it detects humans (N>=1) and then creates bounding box around it. The distance of human is calculated from the pixel values of the bounding boxes. This system is perfect for use in robots like autonomous caddies in malls or airports for transportation which is under-development by Acme. The module detects humans and if the distance is below a threshold, the vehicle slows down. The distance measurements can be fed to the odometry of the robot in order to control its motion. The project could be easily expanded and trained to detect more objects and take actions based on the type of the object. The AIP design process allows continuous development. Because of this, new features and modules could be added over new sprints and thus making the module highly customizable.

## Algorithm

The HOG descriptors convert image into a feature vector. The input image (641283) is converted to a 3780-length vector. The SVM classifier is trained by fitting appropriate parameters to train whether image has human or not. Once it is trained, a sliding window is created of size 64*128 which creates different image patches each of length 3780 feature vector. The SVM is used on each of the feature vector to get whether human is found in that image or not. If it is found, then we store the coordinates to create the bounding boxes. In-order to solve the problem of multiple bounding boxes, we can use a non max suppression to remove overlapping boxes.

## Technology

The monocular camera inputs a stream of images, i.e., video, to our microprocessor. Every frame in the image will be converted into a feature vector by our custom-made HOG feature descriptor. The feature vector will be given as an input to our pre-trained custom-made linear SVM which will classify the features as Human and Non-Human. Further, if there is a human in the frame, the algorithm will calculate the distance of the human from the caddy based on the pixel location and pre-defined equations and assumptions.

## Known Issues and Bugs
- The Human detection module can detect humans if they are standing only if they are present in any other the detection module will fail to detect it.We plan to fix this by training the model to detect humans in different pose.

## Dependencies
- Eigen 3.3.7
- OpenCV 3.3.0

Install dependencies like OpenCV for the project by using the following command.
```
source ./dependencies.sh
```

## Future Updates
- Algorithm can be refined for faster functioning.

- The API can be implemented for any interface that needs the Human detection functionality.

- The Algorithm can be trained and refined to increase it’s accuracy.

## Risks and Mitigation: 
 
A  HOG  is  not  a  rotation  invariant  representation.  This  means 
that  HOG  can  only  vectorize  features  of  images  within  a 
certain orientation range for object detection assignment. This 
can be corrected if we train images with different orientation. 
Monocular camera we have made calibration before 
implementing  while  comparing  the  given  distance  with  the 
calibrated  calculations  instead  we  can  use  depth  cameras  for 
more  accurate  results  like  Intel®  RealSense™ depth camera 
D435. 
HOG is not scale invariant we need to normalize the data to a 
particular scale to overcome this. 
Multiple  detection  boxes  get  created  during  detection  we  can 
use non max suppression to solve that problem.

## Technology Used:
- Ubuntu 18.04 (Operating System)
- Modern C++ (Programming Language)
- CMake (Build System)
- OpenCV library (new BSD License)
- Eigen library (new BSD License)

## Importance of OpenCV and Eigen
- OpenCV is the huge open-source library for the computer vision, machine learning, and image processing and now it plays a major role in real-time operation which is very important in today’s systems. By using it, one can process images and videos to identify objects, faces, or even detect humans.In this project we have used HOG and SVM human detector to detect humans.
- Eigen library is used for transformation of human coordinates from camera frame to world frame.We are using transformation matrix to transform the coordinates to world frame.

## Standard install via command-line
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/gauraut/HOG_Human_Detection
cd <path to repository>
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
Run tests: ./test/cpp-test
Run program: ./app/shell-app
```

## Building for code coverage (for assignments beginning in Week 4)
```
sudo apt-get install lcov
cmake -D COVERAGE=ON -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ../
make
make code_coverage
```
## Making Doxygen documentation

This generates a index.html page in the build/coverage sub-directory that can be viewed locally in a web browser.
How to Generate Doxygen Documentation

To install doxygen run the following command:
```
sudo apt-get install doxygen

Now from the cloned directory run:

doxygen doxygen
```
Generated doxygen files are in html format and you can find them in ./docs folder. With the following command
```
cd docs
cd html
google-chrome index.html
```
